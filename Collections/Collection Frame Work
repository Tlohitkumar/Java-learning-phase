The Java Collection Framework is a unified architecture for storing and manipulating groups of objects. It provides ready-to-use interfaces, classes, and algorithms to handle data efficiently.

It includes:
Interfaces – Core interfaces like List, Set, Queue, Deque, and Map.

Implementations – Concrete classes like ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, PriorityQueue, HashMap, and TreeMap.

Algorithms – Utility methods in the Collections class for sorting, searching, shuffling, reversing, and more.

Utility Classes – Like Collections and Arrays for common operations.

Legacy Classes – Older classes like Vector, Hashtable, and Stack, now part of the framework.

It allows developers to handle data dynamically with powerful features like generics, type safety, and automatic resizing, making Java programming more efficient and less error-prone.
